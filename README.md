# Skin Lesion Detection 

The Automated Skin Lesion Detection and Classification System is aimed at revolutionizing the way skin lesions are diagnosed. Utilizing deep learning techniques, this project seeks to provide a fast, accurate, and non-invasive tool for detecting various types of skin lesions, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, among others. The ultimate goal is to assist dermatologists in early detection and treatment planning, potentially increasing survival rates and improving patient outcomes. 

This project is still underworks, and has been tested to have a model accuracy of 98%.
